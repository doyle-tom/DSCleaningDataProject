Feature Selection 
=================
The features summarized in the resulting dataframe and output file are a subset of the original data available here
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The original data dictionary has been maintained with limited changes for readability and to provide the requisite subset as defined in the Project Assignment.

The features selected for this summary come are the means of mean (_Mean) and standard deviation values (_Std) associated with the signals in the original data set.  An examination of the original set shows that there are 13 discrete signal sets where certain sets also have a dimensional component (XYZ).  These means (_Mean) and standard deviation (_Std) signals associated with sets has been included where as others have been eliminated.
-BodyAcc (time and frequency data for _Mean and _Std for each dimensional component XYZ)-BodyAccJerk (time and frequency data for _Mean and _Std for each dimensional component XYZ)-BodyAccJerkMag (time data from _Mean and _Std)-BodyAccMag (time data from _Mean and _Std)-BodyBodyAccJerkMag (frequency data from _Mean and _Std)-BodyBodyGyroJerkMag (frequency data from _Mean and _Std)-BodyBodyGyroMag (frequency data from _Mean and _Std)-BodyGyro (time and frequency data for _Mean and _Std for each dimensional component XYZ)-BodyGyroJerk (time data for _Mean for each dimensional component XYZ)-BodyGyroJerkMag (time data for _Mean)-BodyGyroMag (time data for _Mean)-GravityAcc (time data for _Mean for each dimensional component XYZ)-GravityAccMag (time data for _Mean
